how is this able to happen on our api. about 5 vtu orders at once. 1 goes through and the others remain pending for life. shouldn't at least their status chnage to failed or something. how is even 5 request withing millisecond able to go through our api.

i was even thinking that to perform some actions on the admin dashboard, we need the admin to pass the autheticator code if mfa is enabaled and if not enabled, it must be enabled before such actions can be approved or have we implemented it?. should even our admin be able to withdraw? isn;t that for users alone?

now let's move to testing. should we test the endpoints first by creating some curls and see if it works? backend is running on localhost 3001 and also create an md of how i should test the admin dashboard with what we implemented and even how to enable mfa.
